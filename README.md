# Python Challenge 1

## Menu Ordering System

This python program is for an interactive ordering system from a food truck menu. The code is structured to carry out multiple aspects of a food order. Those aspects are the following:

* Welcome the user to the Food Truck
* Present the Menu Options
* Get the User to Select Option(s) to Present the Related Menu Category's Sub-menu Items, and Prices
* Ask Customer if They'd Like to Continue Ordering or Not
* Display Back the Complete Order

To carry out the order, the program uses a variety of lists, dictionaries, variables, and values with loops and conditionals. Important elements include:

* List
  * order: A list that stores a list of dictionaries
* Dictionaries
  * menu: A dictionary that includes all the menu data
  * menu_items: A dictionary to store menu orders. *Note* per the assignment there are two dictionaries with the name, menu_items
* Select variables
  * menu_category: A variable that captures a menu number
  * menu_category_name: A variable that captures a menu name
  * menu_selection: A variable that captures a menu item number located in the sub-menu
  * keep_ordering: A variable for tracking whether or not a user wants to continue ordering
